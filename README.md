# Estimating Stock Volatility Using Yang-Zhang Model
This project explores methods for estimating stock volatility using daily trading data. It uses volatility models like the Rogers-Satchell and Yang-Zhang estimators. These models incorporate intraday and overnight price movements to provide a more accurate and robust measure of volatility. The Yang-Zhang estimator, in particular, combines multiple components to correct for bias and is applied to real-world stock data to demonstrate its effectiveness.
